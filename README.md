# PSTimeline

THIS SOFTWARE IS COVERED BY [THIS DISCLAIMER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedges/Disclaimer/master/disclaimer.txt).

Timeline components based on [VisJS Timeline](http://visjs.org/docs/timeline/#Overview) to show record activity such as chatter posts, document uploads, tasks, events, case comments, and records on child objects. Primary use cases could be around health care, social services, case history, etc... basically anything you want to show sequence of 'events' and visual reference to time.

There are two primary components in this package:
  1. <b>PSTimeline (Record)</b> - a component to help show all the activity that occurred for a record. Use this component when you want to show 'events' for a specific record. You can configure to show chatter posts, document uploads, tasks, events, case comments, and records on child objects.
  2. <b>PSTimeline (Object)</b> - a component to help show all records that occurred for a specific object. You would typically use use this component on a Home page or dashboard type page where you are showing all records for a given object.

   - <b>SOQL LIMIT</b> - an integer value to limit the number of records pulled; use this if your data set is very large; suggest testing for demos around limit of 500 or so; the SOQL query that runs pulls records in descending date order so you get recent records

 
### Icons 
For any icon values provided in the component configuration, you have 3 options:
   1. Use a reference to one of the Lightning design icons defined [here](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/). The format of the configuration string is <category>:<name>. So for the first icon in the Action category, the configuration property would be "action:add_contact". For account icon down in the Standard category section, the configuration property would be "standard:account". The component is preconfigured using this approach.
   2. Upload your own static resource file of images you want and reference normal way of "/resource/<image_name>"
   3. Lastly is providing a full http/https URL to an image stored on some remote server

### Filter Fields 
In the PSTimeline (Object) component you can provide a comma-separated-list (CSV) of sObject Field API names to provide filtering capabilities. The component will parse the CSV list and build a pop-up window with filtering options (text box, drop-down lists, etc...). In simplest form, you can enter simple CSV value like

  `Subject,Type,Status,CustomField__c`
  
But you can also provide some more advanced options to each field if needed. The format is '<fieldAPIName>|{option:value,option:value}'. For example, lets say you want to override the standard label for the Type field and provide a default value of 'New'. Your CSV format would look like
  
  `Subject,Type|{"label":"Case Type","value":"New"},Status,CustomField__c`
  
or let's say you want to also enable default wildcard capability (i.e. wrap any text with % chars) for a text field like 'Subject', your string format would be 

  `Subject|{"wildcard":"true"},Type|{"label":"Case Type","value":"New"},Status,CustomField__c`

### Formula Fields 
Remember that you can use formula fields anywhere in the configuration properties where you need to provide a field API name for options like item color, item hover details, item label or item grouping. So for color, you can have a formula field like following to show different background colors for items:

  `CASE(Status,
  "New", "#d9d9d9",
  "Working", "#ccebff",
  "Escalated", "#ffb3b3",
  "Closed", "#adebad",
  "#d9d9d9")`
  
Or show different item icon with formula field like following:

  `LEFT($Api.Partner_Server_URL_260, FIND( '/services', $Api.Partner_Server_URL_260)) & 
    CASE( Type, 
    "Animal Control", "resource/CaseType/OneCityAnimalInactive.png", 
    "Events", "resource/CaseType/OneCityEventsInactive.png", 
    "General Inquiry", "resource/CaseType/OneCityGeneralInactive.png", 
    "Licensing and Permitting", "resource/CaseType/OneCityPermitInactive.png", 
    "Noise", "resource/CaseType/OneCityNoiseInactive.png", 
    "Public Works", "resource/CaseType/OneCityPublicWorksInactive.png", 
    "Street and Traffic", "resource/CaseType/OneCityStreetInactive.png", 
    "resource/CaseType/OneCityNoTypeInactive.png")`
    
And lastly for item hover details, you can have a formula field that has embedded HTML tags to format your hover pop-up as you like:

  `'<h3>Subject + '</h3>' + 
  '<table><tr><td valign="top" style="padding-right: 10px">' + 
  '</td><td>' + 
  '<br/><b>Type:</b> ' + TEXT(Type) + 
  '<br/><b>Status:</b> ' + TEXT(Status) + 
  '<br/><b>Priority:</b> ' + TEXT(Priority) + 
  '</td></tr></table>'`
  
### Deployment Issues 
Depending on the configuration of your target org, you may run in to one of the following deploy errors:
  1. <b>classes/PSTimelineController.cls(305,33):Invalid type: Schema.CaseMilestone</b>   - make sure to [enable Entitlements](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=entitlements_enabling.htm&type=5) in your org

<b>Dependency:</b> Install the [LightningStrike.io](https://github.com/thedges/Lightning-Strike) and [PSCommon](https://github.com/thedges/PSCommon) packages first
